# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in PLANS.md) from design to implementation.

Please write the Exec Plan in Japanese.
Also, please create the Exec Plan under the .agent directory.

Please refer to existing Exec Plans in the .agent directory for examples.
Unless otherwise specified, the working directory is set to the root directory of the repository.

You must not ask users to explain unfamiliar terms.
Implement it according to your interpretation.
However, implement it in a form usable by the user.

The use of Python, Streamlit, and SQLite is permitted. When using other technologies, obtain user approval.

Do not define the meaning of any terms you do not understand.
Asking users for the meaning is also prohibited.
Create entries based solely on your best guess.
